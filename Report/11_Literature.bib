            The influenza A virus ({IAV}) is a continuous health threat to humans as well as animals due to its recurring epidemics and pandemics. The {IAV} genome is segmented and the eight negative-sense viral {RNAs} ({vRNAs}) are transcribed into positive sense complementary {RNAs} ({cRNAs}) and viral messenger {RNAs} ({mRNAs}) inside infected host cells. A role for the secondary structure of {IAV} {mRNAs} has been hypothesized and debated for many years, but knowledge on the structure {mRNAs} adopt in vivo is currently missing. Here we solve, for the first time, the in vivo secondary structure of {IAV} {mRNAs} in living infected cells. We demonstrate that, compared to the in vitro refolded structure, in vivo {IAV} {mRNAs} are less structured but exhibit specific locally stable elements. Moreover, we show that the targeted disruption of these high-confidence structured domains results in an extraordinary attenuation of {IAV} replicative capacity. Collectively, our data provide the first comprehensive map of the in vivo structural landscape of {IAV} {mRNAs}, hence providing the means for the development of new {RNA}-targeted antivirals.},

	abstract = {{UMAP} (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel manifold learning technique for dimension reduction. {UMAP} is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The {UMAP} algorithm is competitive with t-{SNE} for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, {UMAP} has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},

	abstract = {In February 1980, the World Health Organization convened a meeting to consider information relevant to the nomenclature of influenza viruses and to make definitive proposals for the revision of the system which has been in use since 1971. The {WHO} recommendations are based on data derived from double immunodiffusion reactions involving haemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens. The revised system of nomenclature is similar to the 1971 system in that it consists of two parts: (a) a type and strain designation, and (b) for influenza A viruses, a description of the antigenic specificity (subtype) of the surface antigens (H and N). The strain designation for influenza virus types A, B, and C contains information on the antigenic type of the virus (based on the antigenic specificity of the nucleoprotein), the host of origin (for strains isolated from non-human sources), geographical origin, strain number, and year of isolation. For influenza A viruses, the antigenic description, in parentheses, follows the strain designation and comprises two indices describing the antigenic subtype of the haemagglutinin and of the neuraminidase antigens. For the influenza A viruses from all species, the H antigens are grouped into 12 subtypes, H1-H12, while the N antigens are divided into 9 subtypes, N1-N9. Reference strains of influenza viruses are maintained by the {WHO} Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and the {WHO} Centres for the Study of Influenza Ecology in Animals, and are made available upon request.There is no provision for describing distinct subtypes of influenza B and C viruses. The existence of antigenic variation among influenza B strains is well established but the available information shows that a division into subtypes is not warranted.This revised system of nomenclature should be used universally from the date of publication of this Memorandum.},

	abstract = {Influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics and dangerous pandemic outbreaks.  It is a single stranded (-){RNA} virus with a segmented genome.  Eight segments of genomic viral {RNA} ({vRNA}) form the virion, which are then transcribed and replicated in host cells.  The secondary structure of {vRNA} is an important regulator of virus biology and can be a target for finding new therapeutics.  In this paper, the secondary structure of segment 5 {vRNA} is determined based on chemical mapping data, free energy minimization and structure-sequence conservation analysis for type A influenza.  The revealed secondary structure has circular folding with a previously reported panhandle motif and distinct novel domains.  Conservations of base pairs is 87\% on average with many structural motifs that are highly conserved.  Isoenergetic microarray mapping was used to additionally validate secondary structure and to discover regions that easy bind short oligonucleotides.  Antisense oligonucleotides, which were designed based on modeled secondary structure and microarray mapping, inhibit influenza A virus proliferation in {MDCK} cells.  The most potent oligonucleotides lowered virus titer by {\textasciitilde}90\%.  These results define universal for type A structured regions that could be important for virus function, as well as new targets for antisense therapeutics.[on {SciFinder} (R)]},

A previous bioinformatics survey predicted multiple regions of influenza A virus that are likely to generate evolutionarily conserved and stable {RNA} structures.  One predicted conserved structure is in the pre-{mRNA} coding for essential proteins, M1 and M2.  This structure starts 79 nucleotides downstream of the M2 {mRNA} 5' splice site.  Here, a combination of biochem. structural mapping, mutagenesis, and {NMR} confirms the predicted three-way multibranch structure of this {RNA}.

Optical melting curves in 1 M {NaCl} and in 100 {mM} {KCl} with 10 {mM} {MgCl}2 are very similar, with melting temps. ∼14° higher than that for 100 {mM} {KCl} alone.

            The influenza A virus ({IAV}) is a continuous health threat to humans as well as animals due to its recurring epidemics and pandemics. The {IAV} genome is segmented and the eight negative-sense viral {RNAs} ({vRNAs}) are transcribed into positive sense complementary {RNAs} ({cRNAs}) and viral messenger {RNAs} ({mRNAs}) inside infected host cells. A role for the secondary structure of {IAV} {mRNAs} has been hypothesized and debated for many years, but knowledge on the structure {mRNAs} adopt in vivo is currently missing. Here we solve, for the first time, the in vivo secondary structure of {IAV} {mRNAs} in living infected cells. We demonstrate that, compared to the in vitro refolded structure, in vivo {IAV} {mRNAs} are less structured but exhibit specific locally stable elements. Moreover, we show that the targeted disruption of these high-confidence structured domains results in an extraordinary attenuation of {IAV} replicative capacity. Collectively, our data provide the first comprehensive map of the in vivo structural landscape of {IAV} {mRNAs}, hence providing the means for the development of new {RNA}-targeted antivirals.},
